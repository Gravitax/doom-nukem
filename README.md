# doom-nukem

note: 117 / 100

Last project of the 42's graphic branch.
The goal of this project is to make a complete doom-like FPS game in C.

We used the 42's MinilibX library to create our window,
render our images and because of its great performances.

This project is available for MacOs >= Catalina 10.15.4 only.
